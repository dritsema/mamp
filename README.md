This guide is meant to help you through the process of installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Mac OS X Yosemite.  

A reminder that Mac OS X runs atop UNIX, so most UNIX software installs easily on Mac OS X. Furthermore, Apache and PHP come packaged with OS X. To create a local web server, all you need to do is enable them and install MySQL.  

*But wait, isn't there this ultra uber app called MAMP which will do all this for me!? True, this will get you started quickly. But I imagine thats not why you're here. I imagine you're here to learn something, to better understand your environment, and to not be completely lost when something goes wrong, which it innevitabley does. Beyond the basics, what I've found is GUI based tools meant to "increase efficiency" end up costing you more in the long run.*  

 So dig in, enjoy, and check back as often as you find yourself needing a refresher.  For other developer guides beyond the basics of a web server, feel free to check those out too.
