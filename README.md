Yosemite includes Apache 2.4. This post is a complete update for installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Mac OS X Yosemite.

I am aware of the web server software available for Mac OS X, notably MAMP. These get you started quickly. But they forego the learning experience and, as most developers report, can become difficult to manage.
