This guide is meant to help you through the process of installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Mac OS X Yosemite.  There are guides for other Mac based development tools as well beyond the basics so feel free to check those out too if they spark any interest.  

A reminder that Mac OS X runs atop UNIX, so most UNIX software installs easily on Mac OS X. Furthermore, Apache and PHP come packaged with OS X. To create a local web server, all you need to do is enable them and install MySQL.  

But why, when there's this ultra uber app called MAMP which will do it all for me!? True, this will get you started quickly. But I imagine thats not why you're here. I imagine you're here to learn something, to better understand your environment, and to not be completely lost when something goes wrong, which it innevitabley does.  

So dig in, enjoy, and check back as often as you find yourself needing a refresher.
